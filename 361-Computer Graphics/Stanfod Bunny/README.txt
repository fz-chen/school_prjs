I only completed a) - d) for this assignment. All those features should work as expected. 
To rotate the bunny, drag with the right mouse button. 
To translate the bunny, drag with the left mouse button.
Use the up and down arrow keys to translate on the Z plane
Pressing R resets the bunny.

The bunny is lit using a point light that rotates around it. You can pause the rotating point light by pressing P. 
I've also added specular and the bunny. And I also calculated the surface normals of the bunny myself according to notes found on the slide. 

For this assignment, I relied heavily on tutorials online.
For creating 3D objects in webgl, I used MDN's 3D tutorial, found on 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial/Creating_3D_objects_using_WebGL
For lighting, I used
