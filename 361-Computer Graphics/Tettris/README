Tetris

The game is coded by myself, no external resources used. 
The game should behave exactly as expected as from the instructions page.
There is a brief instruction manual floating next to the tetris board.
One additional feature I've added is fast drop. You can press the Space key to instantly drop the block to the bottom of the board.
The game status is display on top of the board.

P.S If you would like to adjust the size of the tetris board, you can do so on line 34 on the HTML file.
